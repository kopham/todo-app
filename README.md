## Todo-List Front-end

### Description About The Project
This project demonstrates a front-end program that uses React JS and Tailwind CSS. This React Todo list app has an input field to allow the user to enter their tasks. The the task will be added in the list.
When the user clicks on any task (or any to-do list) then it will be marked a completed or incomplete task. The user can also delete the to-do items from the list using the delete icon.

### Problems Faced When Working On The Project
While I was working on this project, I faced a challenge trying to figure out the base, componentsm and utilities of Tailwind CSS, because I am new to this framework.
